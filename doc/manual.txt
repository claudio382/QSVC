Basic manual:

Step 1. Install the Kakadu command line tools. Test that the commands
can be executed from any directory of the file system (try for example
if you can call to "kdu_compress").

Step 2. Define the QSVC shell variable:

For example, if QSVC it is installed in the directory $HOME/QSVC, you
should declare:

$ export QSVC=$HOME/QSVC

Step 3. Create a new directory where the "low_0" YUV raw stream it is
located in:

$ mkdir akiyo_compression_example
$ cd akiyo_compression_example
$ ln -s ~/YUV_sequences/akiyo_352x288x300_30Hz.yuv low_0

Step 4. Compressing ...:

$ qsvc compress

as the result, a set of files *.mjc and *type* should be created. These files are the QSVC code-stream.

Step 5. Decompressing ...:

$ mkdir expand
$ cp *.mjc *type* expand
$ cd expand
$ qsvc expand

as the result, the file low_0 is the decompressed YUV sequence.

Use:

$ mplayer low_0 -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo w=352:h=288 -loop 0

to see a low_0 file (YUV data).
